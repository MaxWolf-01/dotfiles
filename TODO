Shell doesn't fully load / hang if no internet? Or rather if slow internet. Due to uv?


- Obsidian (+refactor dependent aliases/funcs like archive_md): think about a better concept for archived web stuff + papers 

- refactor: remove dotbot dep; simple link/... script (or just put it all in install.sh
  - restructure theming / plugins / general dotfiles strucutre to be a bit more straightforward and intuitive?
- fix: android nvim setup or just dont alias vim to nvim
- fix: other platform secific (android) fixes: source android zshr gitconfig [safe]
- fix: separate .obsidian repos or better handling of platform specific differences
- claude idea: instead of treating plans as plans treat them as a global knowledge base
 - -> Where does the index live? Global CLAUDE.md? Rebuild index in every project to have only relevenat context? Nah. Global index, but (periodically; hooks?) pull in information (lines) into project CLAUDE.md? 
 - -> disable auto-compaction, but write a hook on "low" context (actually s.t. like 40-60% is still left) to update global knowledge? Sth like that. And also a hook to like yh do it at the end again, or like write a command for it /update-knowledge
 - -> Needs more thought about how to structure and update and describe lines in the index, how to name files, and whatever. Prlly the naming shouldn't carry too much weight, but have some prefix at least to indicate it's part of the global knowledge vs just a "normal" plan / plan that was created without thinking of it as being global knowledge!
 - -> Then actual PLANS will also work better than the system I have currently, if knowledge is separated.
	  -  ==it's extremely important that claude distinguishes between what he know for a FACT, is pretty confident, suspects, sees as a possibility or is speculating when writing KNOWLEDGE files==
	  - this especially applies for (my) "opinions/preferences" or "decisions we made" - as he often is very happy to overconfidently overinterpret these things
 - =>>> We just need an obsidian++ MCP (alias enhanced search; semantic search; wikilink enhanced search) !  ~~https://www.onyx.md/~~ for parsing power if we need it => memex
 - implementation plans shouldn't duplicate the git history, but augment it - or no, actually, implementation plans are only necessary for facilitating handovers and short-term context integrity
    - this means it's unnecessary to update plan with "finished"? just git commit / git log 
    - and updating the KNOWLDGE with the knowledge. plans should be ephemeral / deleted after commit, and after the learnings have been distilled at the end of the implementation.
    - only update the plan during execution, and only update knowledge at the end of execution? how manual / automatic can I make it?
    - architecture notes etc. are in project specific vaults
    - how to handle todos? single long doc prlly? or split into like "frontend todo" etc. prlly the former.

 - claude idea: "Last words" command, that asks the model whether it still has anything relevant that only it knows (global knowledge, project knowledge, unfinished work, ...) that it wants to write down b4 i say bye forever :(
