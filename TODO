Shell doesn't fully load / hang if no internet? Or rather if slow internet. Due to uv?


- Obsidian (+refactor dependent aliases/funcs like archive_md): think about a better concept for archived web stuff + papers 

- refactor: remove dotbot dep; simple link/... script (or just put it all in install.sh
  - restructure theming / plugins / general dotfiles strucutre to be a bit more straightforward and intuitive?
- fix: android nvim setup or just dont alias vim to nvim
- fix: other platform secific (android) fixes: source android zshr gitconfig [safe]
- fix: separate .obsidian repos or better handling of platform specific differences
- claude idea: instead of treating plans as plans treat them as a global knowledge base
 - -> Where does the index live? Global CLAUDE.md? Rebuild index in every project to have only relevenat context? Nah. Global index, but (periodically; hooks?) pull in information (lines) into project CLAUDE.md? 
 - -> disable auto-compaction, but write a hook on "low" context (actually s.t. like 40-60% is still left) to update global knowledge? Sth like that. And also a hook to like yh do it at the end again, or like write a command for it /update-knowledge
 - -> Needs more thought about how to structure and update and describe lines in the index, how to name files, and whatever. Prlly the naming shouldn't carry too much weight, but have some prefix at least to indicate it's part of the global knowledge vs just a "normal" plan / plan that was created without thinking of it as being global knowledge!
 - -> Then actual PLANS will also work better than the system I have currently, if knowledge is separated.
 - claude tools: install fastmod and astgrep, add instructions to claude.md
 - claude idea: "Last words" command, that asks the model whether it still has anything relevant that only it knows (global knowledge, project knowledge, unfinished work, ...) that it wants to write down b4 i say bye forever :(
