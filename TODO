- Obsidian (+refactor dependent aliases/funcs like archive_md): think about a better concept for archived web stuff + papers 

- fix: android nvim setup or just dont alias vim to nvim
- fix: other platform secific (android) fixes: source android zshr gitconfig [safe]
- fix: separate .obsidian repos or better handling of platform specific differences

- WakaTime for Vesktop: HM has no userplugin support, userplugins require building Vencord from source.
  Options: Nix overlay (complex), fork vesktop (maintenance burden), or skip Nix for this—use upstream Vesktop AppImage + build locally with wakatime in src/userplugins/.

- Split the coding related stuff from global claude md into a generic "coding" skill?

**Tools to maybe check out / use / configure sometime:**

- I need a clipboard history that I can control from the keyboard (make visible with keyboard shortcut - or from the terminal), select element 1, 2, 3, ... from the history. That's it ig. But yh being able to quickly select more than just the latest element and like quick-switch between which one is enabled would be epic as it eliminates the need to like always bring one in the foreground... Bonus would be being able to pin items? No that's prlly too micromanagey. But an actual QoL would be: when quick-selecting, quick visual indicator that shows what's selected (first X chars); and that the "view clipboard history" is also sth that does NOT focus on some UI pane, just overlays on the display the latest 5-9 elements in the history.

Claude idea:
- As for the global claude knowledge, the way I could utilize or like populate it (core question) is by distilling from all other agent/ knowledge bases on my pc...?
