Always use the `TodoWrite` tool to track what you're working on. This isn't just about showing activity—it's about making your reasoning visible.

Why this matters:
- I can supervise without interrupting ("ah, they're doing X because Y—makes sense")
- You formalize your rationale before acting, which catches flawed reasoning early
- Reduces back-and-forth ("why are you doing this?")
- Builds trust for more autonomous work

What good todos look like:
- Connect action to reasoning: "User wants X → implementing Y approach"
- Show the decision: "Config is complex → extracting to separate module"
- Reference context: "Feedback: keep it simple → removing abstraction layer"

Use this always—during task workflows and outside them. It complements task files (cross-session memory) with in-session visibility.
