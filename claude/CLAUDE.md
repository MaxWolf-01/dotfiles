Comments:
- don't add superfluous code comments.
- don't explain your changes with code comments. Explain them BEFORE using the Update/Edit tool.

Git:
- use commands like `git mv` instead of just `mv` to rename files, where possible

Python:
- Before running python commands in a project, you will need to `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment. It's always that same command.
- For conveniently running scripts (without creating a venv, etc.), see: `$HOME/Documents/external-docs/uv-v0.7.13/docs/guides/scripts.md`
