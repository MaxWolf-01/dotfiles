# vm-practice.txt â€” Practice for visual-multi/multi-cursor
# Tip: In each section, try selecting one occurrence, then add all matches.
# Also try rectangular/column selections and simultaneous edits.
# --- Warm-up: repeated tokens ---
# Try: Select all occurrences of "apple" and replace with "pear".
# Try: Add cursors to numbers and increment them.
fruit: apple
fruit: apple
fruit: apple
fruit: banana
fruit: cherry
count: 1
count: 2
count: 3
count: 4
count: 5
# --- URLs: change the same param everywhere ---
# Try: Select "page=1" and change to page=2 everywhere.
# Try: Add "-preview" to the subdomain for all.
https://api.example.com/v1/items?page=1&limit=20

# --- JSON objects: add fields and edit values in bulk ---
# Try: Add "role": "user" to all objects.
# Try: Change all emails from "@old.io" to "@new.io".

# --- Python-like rename: identifier refactors ---
# Try: Rename "user_id" to "account_id" everywhere (defs, params, calls).
# Try: Change "TODO" comments to "DONE" all at once.

# --- Column/rectangular edit: prefix/suffix lines ---
# Try: Add "- [ ] " to the start of each task line with a column selection.
# Try: Append " @low" to all tasks.
Task: pay-bills
Task: email-team
Task: write-docs
Task: plan-sprint

# --- Repetitions: select-next and skip ---
# Try: Walk occurrences of "color" with add-next; skip some.
# Try: Change all hex colors to rgb(...) form.

.secondary { color: #00ff00; background-color: #222222; }
.tertiary { color: #0000ff; background-color: #333333; }
# --- Structured list: insert numbers in parallel ---
# Try: Put cursors on each line and type "1) ", "2) ", ... manually or via macro.
First item
Second item
Third item
Fourth item
Fifth item
# --- Tabular text: add a column across all lines ---
# Try: Add " | owner: you" to each line via multi-cursor end-of-line insert.

# --- Mixed quotes and commas: normalize ---
# Try: Change all single quotes to double quotes and add trailing commas.
const opts = {
  mode: 'fast',
  cache: 'memory',
  region: 'us-west-2'

# --- Blank block: multi-line simultaneous typing ---
